# V2 of my Personal Portfolio and UI experimentation ground

Live at [ammarnasir.com](http://ammarnasir.com/). It's more than just a personal site. I constantly use this website to create and experiment building insanely customizable UI components.

## Why its special to me

Every single component, graphic, and most icons are built from scratch. I built this website starting with my own [Fatefy UI template](https://github.com/Fanoflix/fatefy) to demonstrate Fatefy's complete customizability.
